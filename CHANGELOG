- Accept arbitrary whitespace sequence if the transformer matches the beginning of the line (issue #15)
- Do not sclize bundled libraries in Provides tag (issue #18)
- Add meta runtime dependency for runtime and buildtime automatically and switches to disable them (issues #12,#16)

1.1.3
- Fix regression introduced in previous release.

1.1.2
- Pass options through to subtransformers (thanks Mat Booth for patch).

1.1.1

1.1.0a
- Include templates in source tarball

1.1.0
- New co-maintainer

- Make reading from stdin default
- Recognize %gem_install macro in ruby specfiles
- Ignore file based requires when prefixing with %{?scl_prefix} macro

1.0.1
- If the matched transformed command doesn't end with newline, then add it.
- Fix writing Specfile objects to files with "-i" option.

1.0.0
- Major internal rewrite:
-- gives spec2scl ability to recognize specfile sections and apply certain transforms
   only in certain sections.
-- Transformers are now independent of the specfile they convert, which improves
   testability and makes it easy to use spec2scl as a library.
- spec2scl now runs on Python 3.
- Killed endless loop on generic transformer (thanks Mirek Suchy for reporting).
- Commented commands now don't get sclized (thanks Mirek Suchy for reporting).
- Various fixes for Ruby transformer (thanks Mirek Suchy for reporting).

0.3.4
- Fixed inifinte loop with %{__perl} macro (thanks Andrew Ford for reporting).

0.3.3
- Added support for accepting specfile via pipe using -s parameter.

0.3.2
- %configure and make are general commands, so sclize them
- Recognize and transform dependencies on paths (e.g. Requires: /usr/bin/foo).
- Add PHP specific transformer.

0.3.1
- Fix issue, where having more same commands resulted in having multiple "scl enable" for each.
- Add argparse to install_requires for Python < 2.7 (thanks franz for bug report).

0.3.0
- Handle virtual dependencies with spaces in braces, like "Requires: foo(`do something`)".
- Added switch to add the %{scl}-runtime dependency.
- Renamed from rpm2scl to spec2scl.
- Add Perl specific transformers.
- Fix finding of whole commands.
- Improve handling of multiline commands.
- Improve Ruby transformer to handle "ruby" execution (still needs some attention, though).
- Improved the way to find out whether command needs heredoc for execution.
- Insert {?scl_prefix} even after dependencies separated by just spaces, not commas.
- Fix the bad inserting of %{?scl_prefix} after %{epoch}:
